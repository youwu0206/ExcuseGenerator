Working on the Excuse Generator as my final project has been extremely fulfilling and helpful for my coding skills. It not only sparked my creativity, but it also gave me a hands-on opportunity to code for a complete web application from scratch for the first time. It enhanced my technical skills in coding and allowed me to apply the skills I have learned in this class into something meaningful.
One of the biggest takeaways while working on this project is learning to integrate an API in real-world context. Although I have learned about the basics of APIs previously, I have never fully integrated one on my own. This is the first time that I have integrated the OpenAI API to generate resonses, which taught me the importance of prompt formatting, request/response structure, and error handling. I have became more familiar with environment variables and how to protect sensitive data (like the API key) using .env and .gitignore. 
The project also gave me a deeper understanding of using React. I became more confident using useSTATE and useEffect. I also broke down the interface into reusable components like the ExcuseForm, NavBar, and ExcuseDisplay. which made it easier to organize and debug. Before I got started on the project, the many features and pages felt overwhelming. But after I broke down those features into managle pieces, the overall process went a lot smoother than I thought. 
Another aspect that I had improvements on was styling. It made me realize how alignment, organization, and layout can make a siginificant impact on user experience. For the midpoint check in, I struggled on making the content centered in the middle. When it's not properly formatted, the application felt off and confusing to navigate. After I fixed the formatting, the interface looks a lot more professional and clean. Hover effects and color choices also play an important role inn bringing a positive user experience. 
In my future projects, Something I would do differently is that I would spend more time in planning and wireframing. Before I get started into the coding aspect, I would do sufficient research and plan the structures and organizations more carefully. For example in this project, I didn't know the OpenAI API is not free until I finished implemented it. In the future, I would become more familiar with the stuff I decided to use. 
One important connection I made with the class material is the debugging process. Before taking this class, I wasn't familiar with using the DevTools to debug. This helped me a lot during this project because it's easier to see what the problem is so I can fix it quickly. The debugging process went smoothly and I was able to identify the problem thanks to the DevTools we learned in class. 
Overall, I think this project boosted my confidence in coding. It taught me to balance between creativity and functionality, debug real time issues, and to really think like a developer. I am excited to take the skills I have learned in the project and apply it in the future.
