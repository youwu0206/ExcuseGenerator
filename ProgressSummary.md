# Midpoint progress summary- Excuse Generator

# Project Overview
For my final project, I decided to create an excuse generator that generates excuses based on user input. Users can input their reason
for excuses, such as missing a deadline for homework, and select a tone based on the preferred scenario, the system then generates excuses. Users can save their favorite excuses for later use and they will be displayed in a grid system, color coded based on the tone. 

# Challenges and Solutions
One of the biggest challenges I had is to make the generator page centered horizontally. It's still not centered and I'm still working on it, but I will continue to work through this problem and hopefully it will be resolved soon after altering margins and paddings. Other challenges I encountered such as when rendering the generator page and saved page, I was able to fix it quickly by making sure the wrapping format was placed correctly. 

# Changes from Orginal Proposal
Originally, I planned to use the OpenAI API and Firebase from the start. Now I haven't integrated these features yet because I want to first ensure the core features are working properly. I will intgerate these for the final version. 

# Next Steps
For the final submission, I will integrate Firebase Firestore for persistent saving feature, and add the ability to delete their saved excuses. I will add the OpenAI API to generate more unique and personalized excuses and improve the overall layout and design of the application.
